# COP3502: Computer Science 1 

### About This Repository

Welcome to the repository for all programming assignments from the COP3502 class, Computer Science 1 at the University of Central Florida with professor Arup Guha. This repository contains a curated collection of all the code I've written for the course, designed to demonstrate the implementation of various computer science fundamentals using C. The course primarily focuses on:

- Introducing known algorithms.
- Developing software skills in C programming.
- Utilizing mathematical tools for analyzing algorithms.
- Exploring recursion as a problem-solving technique.
- Implementing data structures using primitive constructs in C.
- Learning about various search and sorting techniques.

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific assignment or topic covered in the syllabus, aimed at building and enhancing these foundational skills.

### Compile and Run

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the program you want to run:

 cd path/to/your/program

3. Compile the C program:

 gcc -o program_name program_name.c

 _Replace program_name with the name of your program file._

4. Run the compiled program:

 ./program_name
