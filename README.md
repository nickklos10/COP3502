# COP3502: Computer Science 1 

### About This Repository

Welcome to the repository for all programming assignments from the COP3502 class, Computer Science 1. This repository contains a curated collection of all the code I've written for the course, designed to demonstrate the implementation of various computer science fundamentals using C. The course primarily focuses on:

- Introducing known algorithms.
- Developing software skills in C programming.
- Utilizing mathematical tools for analyzing algorithms.
- Exploring recursion as a problem-solving technique.
- Implementing data structures using primitive constructs in C.
- Learning about various search and sorting techniques.

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific assignment or topic covered in the syllabus, aimed at building and enhancing these foundational skills.

### Repository Structure

Each directory within this repository is organized according to the topic it covers. Here's a breakdown of the directory structure:

- Algorithms/ - Contains examples and implementations of standard algorithms introduced in the course.
- C Programming/ - Sample programs and assignments that enhance software development skills in C.
- Algorithm Analysis/ - Exercises and examples demonstrating the mathematical analysis of algorithms.
- Recursion/ - Problems and solutions exploring recursion techniques.
- Data Structures/ - Code implementing various data structures from scratch using C.
- Search and Sort/ - Implementations of different searching and sorting algorithms.

### Compile and Run

1.Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.Navigate to the directory containing the program you want to run:

 cd path/to/your/program

3.Compile the C program:

 gcc -o program_name program_name.c

 Replace program_name with the name of your program file.

4.Run the compiled program:

 ./program_name
